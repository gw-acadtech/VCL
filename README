ASF Inubation Disclaimer: Apache VCL is an effort undergoing incubation at the
Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.

Management Node Backend Conditional Dependencies:
Both bare-metal and virtual machine provisioning require a dhcp server
running on the management node listening on the private network.

Physical/Bare-metal provisioning.
If you want to provision bare-metal or pysical computers such as
blades. You will need xCAT setup and working. This release supports
either xCAT 1.3 or xCAT 2.1. This is useful for very large setups, very
custom environments, HPC intergration, automating vmhost servers eith
ESX standard or VMWare Free Server.

VMware Virtual machine provisioing.
If you want to provision virtual machines on ESX or ESXi, you will need
the VMware vsphere toolkit. This toolkit can be obtained from:
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/viperltoolkit/
This toolkit is a set of perl modules.
The toolkit is not required if using Vmware Free server 1.x.

Windows XP/2003/Vista/2008
If provisioning Windows OS, you will need the following:
- Sysprep - used for preparing Windows environments before an image is captured
- NewSID - used for preparing Windows environments before an image is captured
- SPDrvScn - used for scanning device drivers for Windows environments before an
  image is captured
You will need to copy these files to the <vcl/tools/> directory per the
install instructions in the INSTALLATION file.
